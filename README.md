The Smart Parking System is an embedded system developed as part of the CS4111 course project. This system utilizes Arduino microcontrollers and sensors to provide an intelligent parking solution with integrated fire detection and prevention capabilities.

## Hardware Components

The following hardware components were used in this project:

- 1 breadboard
- 1 smoke/gas sensor
- 2 ultrasonic distance sensors
- 1 push button
- 1 potentiometer
- 1 piezo buzzer
- LCD display screen

The breadboard serves as the central hub for connecting and organizing the components, providing a convenient platform for prototyping without the need for soldering.

## Usage

To use the Smart Parking System, follow these steps:

1. Set up the hardware components as described in the project report.
2. Connect the Arduino board to your computer.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the "sketch.ino" code to the Arduino board.
4. Ensure that the connections and sensors are properly configured.
5. Power on the system and observe the LCD display for parking space availability and any fire/smoke detection alerts.
6. Use the push button to interact with the system and deactivate alarms if necessary.
